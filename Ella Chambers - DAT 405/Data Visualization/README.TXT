During my brainstorming process, I decided that I could visualise data either from music or movies, they are two things that I am very interested in and I thought they could both be fun to visualise. So I started to look for some RSS feeds for the top 40. I did however come across various issues with this, and kept getting certain error codes in the console. 

I was able to find the data that I wanted using an apiKey and IMDBâ€™s information that they have on their site. I will use the movies name, box office number. To make the webpage look more interesting I used photoshop to create an image. I had issues when trying to add this to my code, originally I set is as a background in css, but quickly realised that the text was then loading incorrectly on the screen, so I then added the image through javascript. 

During the coding process, I came across several issues, and I had to try out various methods to get the affect I wanted. I ended up using Boolean switches to allow the title of the movie to change when the user interacts with the webpage. Due to the angles, I had to use circles to plot the radius of the mouseX and mouseY points, I found it quite challenging to start with but at the end I was proud of what I had created.  If I had more time I would have liked to of used classes to add the cursor in so that the user can see that there is something for them to click on.
